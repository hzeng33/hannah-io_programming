About (h2)
(p) Hi, I'm Hannah. I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from CUNY Queens College, aspiring to become a Software Developer. 
Currently, I'm seeking a full-time position as a junior software developer. During my time as a web development fellow in the CUNY 
Tech Prep program, I gained valuable experience in building websites. In my spare time, I enjoy watching anime,  
photography, and playing Genshin Impact.  I'm always up for a challenge, whether it's a new coding project or exploring the latest 
episode of my favorite anime.
