      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Hannah. I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from CUNY Queens
        College, with a strong passion for software development. I am currently
        seeking a full-time position as a junior software developer where I can
        apply my skills and continue to grow in the field. During my time as a
        web development fellow in the CUNY Tech Prep program, I gained valuable
        hands-on experience collaborating with other fellows to build websites.
        This experience sparked my interest in creating innovative and efficient
        solutions through code. In my spare time, I enjoy watching anime,
        photography, and playing Genshin Impact. These hobbies allow me to stay
        creative and unwind, which in turn fuels my drive to tackle new coding
        challenges with fresh perspectives. I am always eager to learn and
        embrace new technologies, whether it's diving into a new coding project
        or exploring the latest advancements in the tech world.
